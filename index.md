# Hello world! 

Welcome to my data science portfolio! I'm Sebastian and I'm currently an analyst at NHS England. This website is under development, but feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-gonzalez-martinez-1a064612b) in the meantime. 

### Publicly available work:
* [Patient Safety Event Data Quarterly Publication](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/patient-safety-data/) 
  > I have contributed to the development of this quarterly publication, in my role as data analyst in the [patient safety analysis team](https://github.com/nhs-england-patient-safety). This report provides country-wide statistics on the number of patient safety events reported to the Learn from Patient Safety Events (LFPSE) service. 
  >
  > *Latest issue:* [Quarter 1 2025/26 (April to June 2025)](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/patient-safety-data/2025-26/quarter-1-2025-26-april-may-june-2025/)

### Data science projects:
* [Predicting loan payback](./docs/loan-payback/intro-and-eda.html) (Machine learning) 
  > This project walks through different stages of approaching a classification problem, from exploratory data analysis to model selection. I examine different machine learning methods to propose an optimal model to predict whether a person pays a loan back.
