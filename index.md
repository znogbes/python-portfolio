# Hello world! 

Welcome to my data science portfolio! I'm Sebastian and I'm currently an analyst at NHS England. This website is under development, but feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-gonzalez-martinez-1a064612b) in the meantime. 

### Publically available work:
* [Patient Safety Event Data Quarterly Publication](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/patient-safety-data/) 
  > I have contributed to the development of this quarterly publication, in my role as data analyst in the [patient safety analysis team](https://github.com/nhs-england-patient-safety). This report provides statistics on the number of safety events reported to the Learn from Patient Safety Events (LFPSE) service.
